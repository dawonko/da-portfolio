### Using R 

#Group assignment2 : Gender and Racial Bias in Perceptions of Others’ Pain 
#A group of researchers at the University of Virginia investigated whether people 
#estimate a different level of pain when the race (i.e., White, Black, Hispanic, or 
#Asian) and gender (i.e., Female or Male) of a victim are varied. To test this idea, the 
#researchers ran a randomized experiment (dataset: “tess.csv”). In this experiment, 
#participants were first asked to report the amount of pain they would feel when 
#they stub their toe on a chair leg (Q4: 0 Not painful to 10 Extremely painful; -1 
#Refused). They were then randomly assigned to see only one of the following 24 
#photos (XTESS089). That is, each participant saw a photo of a Black, Hispanic, Asian, 
#or White target person of either gender. Following the treatment, participants were 
#asked to estimate the amount of pain the target person would feel in the same 
#situation above (Q8: 0 Not painful to 10 Extremely painful; -1 Refused). 




#a. Test whether or not the collected sample is skewed in terms of participants’ 
#political ideology (XIDEO: 1 Extremely liberal; 2 Liberal; 3 Slightly liberal; 4 
#Moderate, middle of the road; 5 Slightly conservative; 6 Conservative; 7 Extremely 
#conservative; -1 Refused).

tess<-read.csv(file.choose(),header=TRUE)
tess$XIDEO<-tess$XIDEO
tess$XIDEO[tess$XIDEO==-1]<-NA
t.units<-t.test(tess$XIDEO,mu=4,conf.level=0.95)
t.units

#H0: The collected sample is not skewed.
#H1: The collected sample is skewed.

#Based on the XIDEO, if the collected sample is not skewed, the mean should be 4. 
#Thus, we used One-sample t-test to know p-value and it was 0.2438, which is bigger than 0.05
#So, the null hypothesis is not rejected. 
#Also, the mean of the collected sample (3.964136) belongs to 95% confidence interval, [3.903808,4.024464]/
#It means that the mean can be estimated as 4, 95% sure.
#The collected sample is not skewed in terms of participants' political ideology.



#b. Test whether people’s self-reported pain differs from their estimation of others’ pain.

tess<-read.csv(file.choose(),header=TRUE)
tess$Q4<-tess$Q4
tess$Q4[tess$Q4==-1]<-NA
tess$Q8<-tess$Q8
tess$Q8[tess$Q8==-1]<-NA
t.test(tess$Q4,tess$Q8,paired=T)

#H0: People's self-reported pain doesn't differ from their estimatio of other's pain
#H1: People's self-reported pain differs from their estimation of other's pain.

#Used Paried t-test to prove, t was 5.4409 and the p-value was 5.915e-08 which is smaller than 0.05.
#so, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.

#c. Test whether people estimate others’ pain differently depending on the gender of a victim.

#H0: People doesn't estimate other's pain differently depending on the gender of a victim
#H1: People estimate other's pain differently depending on the gender of a victim

#To test whether people estimate other's pain differently depending on the gender of a victim,
#one-way ANOVA can be used. According to the test, F ratio was 19.56, and p-value was 1.02e-05.
#As the p-value is smaller than 0.05, null hypothesis is rejected, and alternative hypothesis is accepted.
#Therefore, means are different(It may vary depending on the conditions).

#To compare the difference between two mean scores, Tukey's HSD test can be used. 
#Difference between two mean of gender(male-female) groups was 0.4334762. 
#Adjusted p-value was 1.02e-05. It is smaller than 0.05, null hypothesis is rejected, and alternative hypothesis is accepted,
#As a result, there are difference between the mean of two groups.
