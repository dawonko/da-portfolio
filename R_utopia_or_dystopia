###Using R 

#Group Assignment1 : Internet: Utopia or Dystopia? 
#A number of scholars have pointed to the Internet for its deleterious effects on 
#human well-being, given that it can exacerbate loneliness, depression and social 
#isolation. In contrast, others believe that the Internet can enhance the quality of life 
#by precipitating the emergence of a new type of social aggregation. Using the data 
#collected by the PEW research center (dataset: “pew.csv”), perform a chi-square test 
#to see if Internet use (intuse: 1 Yes; 2 No; 8 Don’t know; 9 Refused) upgrades or 
#downgrades the quality of life (q1: 1 Excellent; 2 Very good; 3 Good; 4 Fair; 5 Poor; 8 
#Don’t know; 9 Refused). Do the data support the utopian or dystopian view about 
#the Internet?

#1)p값이 0.05보다 작으므로 인터넷 사용과 삶의 질 사이에 관련성이 있는 것으로 나타났다.
#2)인터넷 사용을 하는 경우에는 "Excellent","Very Good"에서 관측빈도>기대빈도이므로 
3상관성이 높은 것을 알 수 있고 인터넷 사용을 하지 않는 경우에는 “Excellent","Very Good"에서 관측빈도<기대빈도이므로 
#상관관계가 낮음을 알 수 있다. 그러므로 인터넷사용에 대해 유토피아적인 관점을 취하고 있음을 알 수 있다. 

#First of all, we should think about the dependence between Quality of Life(QOL) and Internet use(IU) before thinking about further Ideas.

#H0: Quality of Life is independet of the internet use 
#H1: Quality of Life is not independent of the internet use

#Chi-square test is used to check dependence, p-value is 2e-16 which is smaller than 0.05.
#So the null hypothesis(H0) is rejected and alternative hypothesis is accepted.
#QL is not independent of the IU.

#And we compared the observed and expected frequencies to obtain an idea about the dependence between QL and IU.
#We see that Internet Users have higher observed than expected frequencies for both "Excellent" and "very Good", 
#whereas, No internet users have a higher observed than expected frequencies for "Good", "fair, and "Poor".
#Even though it has higher observed frquency of "Good", the difference between observed and expected frequencies of "Fair"
#and "Poor" are biiger than "Good" one. It means it is related to "Fair" and "Poor" more.
#These observations give give us insight about the QL difference between Internet users and No Internet users.
# Therefore, the data support the utopian view about the Internet.
